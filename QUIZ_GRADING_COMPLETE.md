export interface QuizResultsProps {
  // ... existing fields

// Quiz submission
const submitQuizAttempt = useMutation(api.progress.submitQuizAttempt);
await submitQuizAttempt({
  contentItemId: contentItem.id,
  answers,
  score: finalScore,
  maxScore,
});

// Attempt history
const attemptHistory = useQuery(
  api.progress.getQuizAttemptHistory,
  contentItem?.isGraded && contentItem?.id 
    ? { contentItemId: contentItem.id }
    : "skip"
);
```

## 🎯 Summary

**Completion Status: 5/7 tasks (71%)**

### ✅ HIGH PRIORITY Complete (5/5)
1. ✅ Quiz grading UI
2. ✅ Backend submission

4. ✅ Retake functionality
5. ✅ Attempt history

### ⏳ LOW PRIORITY Remaining (2/2)
6. ⏳ Admin content grading toggle
7. ⏳ Course edit form updates

### Impact
The certification system is now **fully functional** for students:
- Students can take graded quizzes
- Scores are tracked and saved
