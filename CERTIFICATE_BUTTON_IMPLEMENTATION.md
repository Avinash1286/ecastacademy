# Certificate Button & Milestone Tracking - Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. **Always Visible Certificate Button**
The certificate button is now **always visible** for certification courses, but disabled when requirements are not met.

**Before**: Button only appeared when eligible
```tsx
{courseProgress.eligibleForCertificate && (
  <Button>Get Certificate</Button>
)}
```

**After**: Button always shows, disabled state when not eligible
```tsx
<Button 
  disabled={!courseProgress.eligibleForCertificate}
  className={eligible ? "bg-amber-500" : "bg-muted cursor-not-allowed"}
>
  Get Certificate
</Button>
```

### 2. **Milestone Tracking in Tooltip**
When hovering over the Grade progress bar, users see a detailed checklist of certificate requirements:

#### **Milestone 1: Complete All Graded Items**
- ✓ Shows green checkmark when all graded items attempted
- Shows count: `X/Y attempted`
- Grayed out until completed

#### **Milestone 2: Pass All Graded Items**
- ✓ Shows green checkmark when all items passed
- Shows count: `X/Y passed`
- Grayed out until completed

#### **Milestone 3: Achieve 70% or Higher Grade**
- ✓ Shows green checkmark when overall grade ≥ 70%
- Shows current grade: `Current: X%`
- Grayed out until completed

### 3. **Backend Updates**

Added `attemptedGradedItems` field to `calculateCourseProgress` query in `convex/completions.ts`:

```typescript
{
  gradedItems: 10,              // Total graded items in course
  attemptedGradedItems: 8,      // How many user attempted
  passedGradedItems: 6,         // How many user passed
  overallGrade: 75.5,           // Overall grade percentage
  eligibleForCertificate: false // Not eligible (not all attempted)
}
```

## Visual Design

### Certificate Button States

**Eligible (Enabled)**:
- Background: `bg-amber-500`
- Hover: `hover:bg-amber-600`
- Text: White
- Icon: Award icon (amber)
- Clickable link to certificates page

**Not Eligible (Disabled)**:
- Background: `bg-muted`
- Text: `text-muted-foreground`
- Cursor: `cursor-not-allowed`
- Tooltip: "Complete all requirements to unlock certificate"

### Milestone Checklist UI

Each milestone shows:
- **Circle indicator**: 
  - Empty circle (border only) when incomplete
  - Green filled circle with ✓ when complete
- **Title**: Bold text, colored based on completion
- **Progress text**: Small gray text showing X/Y or current value

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Just Started Course
```
Milestone 1: ○ Complete all graded items (0/10 attempted)
Milestone 2: ○ Pass all graded items (0/10 passed)
Milestone 3: ○ Achieve 70% or higher grade (Current: 0%)
[Get Certificate] - DISABLED
```

### Scenario 2: Mid-Progress
```
Milestone 1: ○ Complete all graded items (7/10 attempted)
Milestone 2: ○ Pass all graded items (5/10 passed)
Milestone 3: ○ Achieve 70% or higher grade (Current: 65%)
[Get Certificate] - DISABLED
```

### Scenario 3: All Attempted, Some Failed
```
Milestone 1: ✓ Complete all graded items (10/10 attempted)
Milestone 2: ○ Pass all graded items (8/10 passed)
Milestone 3: ○ Achieve 70% or higher grade (Current: 68%)
[Get Certificate] - DISABLED
```

### Scenario 4: All Requirements Met
```
Milestone 1: ✓ Complete all graded items (10/10 attempted)
Milestone 2: ✓ Pass all graded items (10/10 passed)
Milestone 3: ✓ Achieve 70% or higher grade (Current: 85%)
[Get Certificate] - ENABLED (amber, clickable)
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Progress Visibility**: Users always see what they need to do
2. **Motivation**: Checkmarks provide gamification and sense of progress
3. **No Confusion**: Button is always there, no "where did it go?" moments
4. **Guided Learning**: Users know exactly which items need attention
5. **Transparency**: All requirements visible at a glance

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. User completes quiz → `recordCompletion` mutation
2. Progress updated in database
3. `calculateCourseProgress` query recalculates:
   - Completion percentage
   - Graded items attempted/passed
   - Overall grade
   - Eligibility status
4. Frontend reactively updates:
   - Progress bars
   - Milestone checkmarks
   - Certificate button state

### Performance
- All data fetched in single `calculateCourseProgress` query
- Real-time updates via Convex reactivity
- No additional queries needed for milestones
- Tooltip content rendered on hover (no performance impact)
